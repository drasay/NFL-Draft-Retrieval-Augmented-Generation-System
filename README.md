# NFL-Draft-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-System
This RAG pipeline transforms defensive line scouting reports (PDF/PPTX) into an actionable database using ChromaDB. It compares two embedding models (MiniLM vs. E5) to retrieve context, using GPT-4 with a "Map-Reduce" strategy to synthesize coaching insights. Finally, it runs a data-driven evaluation to benchmark accuracy and relevance.
